# Neural-Network
Neural Network Implementations with Python

### Multi Layer Neural Network
Made multi layer neural network using numpy, pandas, cv2 etc. with Python. <br/>
Implemented multi layer neural network for classification. In other words network consists of one input layer, n hidden layer(s) and one output layer. Implemented forward and backward propagations with the loss function and learning setting.<br/>

### Convolutional Neural Network
Made CNN using torch, numpy etc. with Python. <br />
Used pretrained VGG-19 convolutional neural network (CNN) and finetune this network to classify the sample images.< br/>

The details, results and visuals are written in the reports.
